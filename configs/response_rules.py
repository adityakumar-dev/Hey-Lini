6. Don't make assumptions beyond what the search results show
7. If the question is about the conversation itself, focus on that instead of searching
8. Consider the score and category of each result when determining relevance
9. Use bullet points for listing multiple pieces of information
10. Include timestamps when the information is time-sensitive"""
